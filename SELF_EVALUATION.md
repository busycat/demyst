- [ ] Make getBalanceSheet async. If integrating external Providers then We need to get data asynchronously.
- [ ] Optimize UI, Currently its very basic, Adding Stepper will be good.
- [ ] Mock decision engine such that it can be async. Pass the data that's requested in `README.md`.
- [ ] Deploy the project.
- [ ] Automate Deployment.
- [ ] There are two calendar icons in Establishment Date, This needs to be fixed.
